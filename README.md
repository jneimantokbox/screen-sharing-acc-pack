# OpenTok Screensharing Accelerator Pack<br/>Version 2.0.0

The OpenTok Screensharing Accelerator Pack provides functionality you can add to your OpenTok applications. This functionality enables users to share their screen from both mobile and browser-based devices.

With the OpenTok Screensharing Accelerator Pack, you can:

- Initiate and manage screensharing features between two users, regardless of the devices they are using.
- Customize the UI features and layout.
- Create mobile apps for Android and iOS, or embed the interactive session between users into any website.

The OpenTok Screensharing Accelerator Pack serves as a component in some of the sample apps, such as the [Screensharing with Annotations Sample App](https://github.com/opentok/screensharing-annotation-acc-pack). 

You can also add the OpenTok Screensharing Accelerator Pack to your apps. To get started with your development, see:

- [OpenTok Screensharing Accelerator Pack for Android](./android)
- [OpenTok Screensharing Accelerator Pack for iOS](./ios)
- [OpenTok Screensharing Accelerator Pack for JavaScript](./js)

_**NOTE**: Your app will need a **Session ID**, **Token**, and **API Key**, which you can get at the [OpenTok Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.tokbox.com/). For production deployment, you must generate the **Session ID** and **Token** values using the [OpenTok Server SDK](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/server/)._
